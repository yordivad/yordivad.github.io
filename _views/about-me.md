# About Me


Hi, I have been working for many years in the sector of the programming. Most of my work have been as programmer, Also
I had been having the title or labels of different roles as Architect, Team Lead, Tech Lead, but all of these labels are that ones
LABELS. I really like to describe my self as a Human that want to be light in this world that are close to change.


My strengths are really the abstract capacity of understanding, and also research, learning is a favorite
topic on my life. I have been researching on Quantum Fields, String Theory, Electricity, Relativity, Category Theory, Language Philosophy,
Mental Philosophy, Neuroscience, Logic and Modal Logic, Linear and Abstract algebras and Kabbalah.

I enjoy to thinking in complex problems as: Why are we here? And try to find a possible solution. I developed a philosophical
point of the view about the metaphysics, that consist in treat the metaphysics as supposition enunciates and next apply
Logic to derive consequences on possibles worlds.

I believe, and I know, that we are never going to derive all the truths, and we are limited by our language. So, that
means that all sciences and all human knowledge are circumstantial and possible, and the metaphysics reigns on it. Look
at the Godel theorems.

So if all the knowledge is impregnated by metaphysics, the logical conclusion of this one is: We don't know anything.
And we are not going to know all. So that means that my influence as philosopher is Socratic. Also for many years of my life
I declare to myself as Wittgenstein pupil to declare that the only truth is the Logical truth. But, today I believe that also
needs to verify the rules and the axioms of the formal system.

In order with the spirituality my last years I am started to embrace the Kabbalah to my soul path, and now I want to be the best 
human possible in this world or in this simulation. The kabbalah has shown me that the altruism and love of all people in this planet 
is the right way to bring a messianic conscience.
